<p>As an avid user of <a href="https://github.com/RobotsAndPencils/Xcodes">xcodes</a>&mdash;a really handy CLI utility to manage multiple versions of the Xcode on a mac&mdash;when there was a need for a macOS icon for a GUI version of the app, I felt the itch to try my hand at some icon design.</p>
<p>My goal was to create an icon that felt at home on the dock of Big Sur, and included a familiar hammer that many iOS devs would recognize.</p>
