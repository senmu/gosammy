<p>Tesco's Clubcard loyalty app as of mid-2016 suffered from instability and poor retention amongst their userbase. Tired of receiving scathing reviews on the App Store, Tesco brought in myself, along with a few other colleagues to improve all aspects of the app. Over the course of a year and a half, I helped lead a modernization effort involving the rewrite of the app's architecture, resulting in improved stability, as well as provide consultation on how to better the user experience of the app, and the rollout of a new, digital rewards experience.</p>
<p>The efforts paid off as favourable reviews came in, boosting the overall App Store rating from 1 to 4.7 stars.</p>
