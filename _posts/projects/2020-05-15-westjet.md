<p>Between 2018-2020, I served as Delivery Lead for the WestJet iOS app and oversaw 20+ releases for the App Store. During this time, I was involved with localizing the app to support 5 languages, implementing new features to support the revamped loyalty program, and interface with the product owners and the design team to prototype future sections of the app.</p>
