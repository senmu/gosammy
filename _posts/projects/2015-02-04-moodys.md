<p>A companion for Canadian "snowbirds" who flock to warmer climates during Canadian winters&mdash;this app provided useful tools and notifications ahead of time as one is on the verge of having been out of the country too long, so to avoid the additional tax implications.</p>
<p>Using Core Data to persist user entered data, it presented easy to digest visualizations to inform how close you'd be to that important threshold, which was also brought to life with Core Animation.</p>
